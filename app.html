        <h2 class="steps">1- The web</h2>
        The World Wide Web is made up of HTML.
HTML means- HyperText Markup Language
Hyper (Links) where Invented in the 1990s.  Today there is roughly 30 billion pages availible on the internet.  But how does this system work?  Well, there is an information system on the Internet that allows documents to be connected to other documents by hypertext links, enabling the user to search for information by moving from one document to another.
        <h2 class="steps">2- HTML</h2>
 Hypertext Markup Language, is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
        <h2 class="steps">3- Tags and Elements</h2>
 HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.
        <h2 class="steps">4- HTTP</h2>
 HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for transferring files (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web. As soon as a Web user opens their Web browser, the user is indirectly making use of HTTP
        <h2 class="steps">5- Web Applications</h2>
 A web application or web app is any software that runs in a web browser. It is created in a browser-supported programming language (such as the combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS) and relies on a web browser to render the application.<br/>

        <h1 class="centered" id="unit-2">Unit 2: Using HTML to create a structured Document</h2>
        <br/>
        <h2 class="steps"> 1- See HTML as a web page</h2>
 Imagine the world of Web as a house.  There is three main parts to a house to make it durable.  Walls, The style of your house, and the interactive components.  In this case your walls are HTML.  Your style is CSS.  and Your interactive components would be JS.  This way we can start to see web sites as HTML
        <h2 class="steps">2- See a web page as HTML</h2>
 So now that we understand how to see a website when we look at HTML, We should try the other side of that coin.  Seeing a Web page as HTML.  Find a Web page and look at the different parts.  Which parts are the walls?(HTML) What parts look like style elements?(CSS) Is there any buttons or moving parts?(JS)
        <h2 class="steps">3- Add structure to your page</h2>
 Adding structure to your page is fairly simple.  It involves three main steps. 1- Gathering ideas.  2- Put your idea to HTML.  3- use CSS to bring it to life.
        <h2 class="steps">4- Avoid repetition with CSS</h2>
 Something that all programmers try to avoid is using the same stylistic “spice” over and over.  Because once you use the same element, again, again, it loses it’s “spice”  Avoid repetition. <br/>

<h1 class="centered" id="unit-3">Unit 3: Adding CSS</h1>
        <h2 class="steps">1- Make your page look good</h2>
 Now we have almost finished everything we need to learn before we can make our own very basic Web page.  But We still have to make that page look good.  We do that by adding CSS,  The sugar on the pudding… If people did that.  Style elements are used to give your Website that extra flair.  Although CSS is one of the more complicated steps its worth the time to learn it, And it’s pretty sweet.
        <h2 class="steps">2- Keep pushing the boundaries of today, into tomorrow</h2>
 Perhaps the most important part of Programming is developing a Never giving up mentality.  To really become successful at anything we do, we can’t be afraid of making mistakes, learning, trying, failing, learning more, and still messing up.  Because if we really do push the boundaries of today into tomorrow, We can’t be held back, And we will succeed.
